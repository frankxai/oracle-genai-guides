## Decision Tree

### 1. What are you building?

**Just need LLM capabilities?**
→ **Oracle GenAI Service**
- Text generation, chat, embeddings
- No agent logic required
- Direct API integration

**Need autonomous agents with tools?**
→ Go to #2

### 2. Who will build and manage agents?

**Enterprise team with ML expertise**
→ **Oracle AI Agent**
- Full control over agent logic
- Custom tool integration
- Production monitoring

**Business users / Citizen developers**
→ **AI Agent Studio**
- Low-code configuration
- Pre-built templates
- Fusion integration

### 3. How many agents? Need orchestration?

**Single agent or few independent agents**
→ AI Agent is sufficient

**Multiple agents that need to collaborate**
→ **Add Agent Hub**
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Shared memory/context
- Workflow orchestration

### 4. Data sovereignty requirements?

**Standard OCI regions acceptable**
→ Use cloud versions above

**Must host in private environment**
→ **Private AI Agent Studio**
- Isolated tenancy
- No data leaves your OCI
- Maximum compliance

## Use Case Examples

### Example 1: Customer Support Chatbot

```
Requirement: Handle customer inquiries, access knowledge base

Recommended Stack:
├── AI Agent Studio (for rapid prototyping)
│   └── Configure Q&A agent with knowledge base tool
├── Or for production scale:
├── AI Agent (for full control)
│   └── Custom RAG implementation
│   └── Multi-turn conversation management
└── GenAI Service (for LLM backbone)
    └── Embedding generation
    └── Text generation
```

### Example 2: Code Generation for Developers

```
Requirement: AI-assisted coding with Oracle/Grok integration

Recommended Stack:
├── AI Agent
│   └── Custom tool definitions (file system, git, APIs)
├── GenAI Service OR Grok Code-1
│   └── Model serving
└── OpenCode Integration
    ├── OpenCode
    ├── Roo Code
    └── Kilo Code
        └── Connect to AI Agent via API
```

### Example 3: Enterprise Document Processing

```
Requirement: Process contracts, extract entities, automate workflows

Recommended Stack:
├── Private AI Agent Studio (data residency)
│   └── All processing stays in tenancy
├── Agent Hub (orchestration)
│   └── Document → Entity Extraction → Approval Workflow
└── GenAI Service
    └── Text analysis
    └── Summarization
```

### Example 4: Multi-Agent Research Team

```
Requirement: Research, analyze, and report on market data

Recommended Stack:
├── Agent Hub
│   └── Orchestrate agent collaboration
├── AI Agent × 3
│   ├── Researcher Agent (web search, APIs)
│   ├── Analyzer Agent (data processing)
│   └── Writer Agent (report generation)
└── GenAI Service
    └── All agents use shared LLM backbone
```

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct API (Simplest)

```
Application → GenAI Service API
```

**When**: Simple LLM integration, no agent complexity
**Pros**: Easy, serverless, pay-per-use
**Cons**: No autonomous behavior

### Pattern 2: Agent with Tools

```
Application → AI Agent → Tools + GenAI Service
```

**When**: Autonomous behavior needed, custom tools
**Pros**: Full control, extensible
**Cons**: More complex to build

### Pattern 3: Orchestrated Multi-Agent

```
Agent Hub → AI Agent 1 → AI Agent 2 → AI Agent 3
                ↓              ↓
            GenAI Service   GenAI Service
```

**When**: Complex workflows, multiple specialized agents
**Pros**: Handles complexity, reusable agents
**Cons**: Highest complexity

### Pattern 4: Enterprise Private Deployment

```
Private Network → Private AI Agent Studio → OCI Services (restricted)
```

**When**: Maximum security/compliance required
**Pros**: Complete control, data never leaves
**Cons**: Highest operational overhead

## Pricing Considerations

| Service | Entry Price | Scale Price |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| GenAI Service | $0.001/1K tokens (text generation) | Volume discounts available |
| AI Agent | $500/agent/month (basic) | $2,000/agent/month (enterprise) |
| Agent Hub | $200/month | Usage-based overages |
| AI Agent Studio | $1,000/month (per tenant) | Per-user pricing available |
| Private AI Agent Studio | BYOL | Infrastructure costs only |

## Migration Paths

```
Start Simple → Scale Up → Enterprise

GenAI Service → AI Agent → Agent Hub → Private Studio
   (API)        (Custom)  (Orchestrated)  (Self-hosted)
```

## Recommendations

| Team Size | Experience Level | Recommended Starting Point |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 1-5 developers | Beginner | GenAI Service → AI Agent Studio |
| 5-20 developers | Intermediate | AI Agent → GenAI Service |
| 20+ developers | Advanced | AI Agent + Agent Hub |
| Enterprise | Any | Private AI Agent Studio + Agent Hub |

## Pricing Note

> **Oracle GenAI Pricing**: Oracle charges per CHARACTER, not per token. For on-demand inference:
> - Chat models: (prompt_length + response_length) in characters
> - Embedding models: input_length in characters
> - 10,000 characters = 10,000 transactions
> - See: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/pay-on-demand.htm
